```typescript
await fast_edit_blocks({
  path: "/path/to/file.ts",
  edits: [
    {
      old_text: "// old comment 1",
      new_text: "// new comment 1",
      expected_replacements: 1
    },
    {
      old_text: "function oldName()",
      new_text: "function newName()",
      expected_replacements: 1
    }
  ],
  backup: true
});
```

### Key Benefits
