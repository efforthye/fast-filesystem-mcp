# Fast Filesystem MCP
Advanced filesystem operations for Claude Desktop with large file handling capabilities and Claude-optimized features.

## Quick Start
Add to your Claude Desktop config.
- **Basic setup**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "fast-filesystem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "fast-filesystem-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

- **With backup files enabled**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "fast-filesystem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "fast-filesystem-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "CREATE_BACKUP_FILES": "true"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Backup Configuration
Control backup file creation behavior.
- `CREATE_BACKUP_FILES=false` (default): Disables backup file creation to reduce clutter  
- `CREATE_BACKUP_FILES=true`: Creates backup files before modifications

**Note**: Backup files are created with timestamps (e.g., `file.txt.backup.1755485284402`) to prevent data loss during edits.

### Debug and Logging Configuration
The MCP server uses a safe logging system that prevents JSON-RPC communication errors.
- `DEBUG_MCP=true` or `MCP_DEBUG=true`: Enable debug logging to stderr
- `MCP_LOG_FILE=/path/to/log.txt`: Write logs to file instead of stderr
- `MCP_SILENT_ERRORS=true` or `SILENT_ERRORS=true`: Suppress error messages in responses

**Note**: Debug output is automatically suppressed by default to prevent JSON parsing errors in Claude Desktop.

## New Version Update
To update to the latest version, follow these steps.
1. **Uninstall previous version**
   ```bash
   npm uninstall -g fast-filesystem-mcp
   ```
2. **Clean cache and dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm cache clean --force
   pnpm store prune
   ```
3. **Install latest version**
   ```bash
   npm install -g fast-filesystem-mcp
   ```
4. **Verify installation**
   ```bash
   npm list -g fast-filesystem-mcp
   fast-filesystem-mcp --version
   ```
